# Dedicated NestJS Server

## Basetask

Please create a simple NestJS service, which provides a user
management with at least 2 roles. Besides the profile information
(nickname, full name, email, role etc.), each user should be able to
upload his own profile picture. Profile pictures have to be scaled to
a chosen default size.

## Extension

Think about an authentication and authorization solution. Users
should be able to login and be allowed to upload a picture or not,
depending on their role.

## Commands

### pnpm run dev

- backend port 3000

- frontend port 4200

### pnpm run build

### pnpm prisma studio
